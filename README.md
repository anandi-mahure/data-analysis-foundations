# Data Analysis Foundations — Python, Statistics & EDA

Applied data analysis work covering Python for data science, statistical methods, and exploratory data analysis techniques. Each notebook combines conceptual explanation with practical implementation on real datasets.

Part of a wider analytics portfolio — see pinned repositories for production-grade projects.

## What These Notebooks Cover

**Python Deep Dive**
Advanced data structures and their performance characteristics, NumPy for vectorised computation (avoiding loops), Pandas for real-world data manipulation including multi-level grouping, window functions, and time-series resampling, and OOP patterns for building reusable data processing components.

**Statistics & Probability**
Applied statistics grounded in data science use cases rather than pure theory. Covers descriptive statistics with interpretation, probability theory including Bayes' theorem and conditional probability, parameter estimation using MLE and MAP, hypothesis testing with correct interpretation of p-values, and decision theory for data-driven risk analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis**
A reproducible EDA framework applicable to any structured dataset. Covers the full sequence from data profiling (shape, types, nulls, cardinality) through distribution analysis, relationship detection (correlation, chi-squared), and outlier investigation, to feature engineering decisions informed by the analysis. Visualisations include histograms, KDE plots, box plots, scatter matrices, and correlation heatmaps.
